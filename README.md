# week7
this is a simple exponent arithmetic program.
it first asks endusers' names and greets to them.
then it asks for the base and exponent.
finally the program print out the result.
if endusers did wrong input, the program will give them four more chances.
if none of these inputs are correct, the program will laugh at endusers.
