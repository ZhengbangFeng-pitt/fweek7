this is a simple exponent arithmetic program.
it first asks endusers' names and greets to them.
then it asks for the base and exponent.
finally the program print out the result.
if endusers did wrong input, the program will give them four more chances.
if none of these inputs are correct, the program will laugh at endusers.      


the reason why i choose GNU General Public License v3.0 as my license is because it's fair enough, especially the limitation of warranty.          


and the reason i choose Coc as codes of conduct is because it covers the important area and conducts could appear in cooperation and gives fair rules.
